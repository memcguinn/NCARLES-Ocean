!     SUBROUTINE RFFTF(N,R,WSAVE)
!
!     SUBROUTINE RFFTF COMPUTES THE FOURIER COEFFICIENTS OF A REAL
!     PERODIC SEQUENCE (FOURIER ANALYSIS). THE TRANSFORM IS DEFINED
!     BELOW AT OUTPUT PARAMETER R.
!
!     INPUT PARAMETERS
!
!     N       THE LENGTH OF THE ARRAY R TO BE TRANSFORMED.  THE METHOD
!             IS MOST EFFICIENT WHEN N IS A PRODUCT OF SMALL PRIMES.
!             N MAY CHANGE SO LONG AS DIFFERENT WORK ARRAYS ARE PROVIDED
!
!     R       A REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH CONTAINS THE SEQUENCE
!             TO BE TRANSFORMED
!
!     WSAVE   A WORK ARRAY WHICH MUST BE DIMENSIONED AT LEAST 2*N+15.
!             IN THE PROGRAM THAT CALLS RFFTF. THE WSAVE ARRAY MUST BE
!             INITIALIZED BY CALLING SUBROUTINE RFFTI(N,WSAVE) AND A
!             DIFFERENT WSAVE ARRAY MUST BE USED FOR EACH DIFFERENT
!             VALUE OF N. THIS INITIALIZATION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE
!             REPEATED SO LONG AS N REMAINS UNCHANGED THUS SUBSEQUENT
!             TRANSFORMS CAN BE OBTAINED FASTER THAN THE FIRST.
!             THE SAME WSAVE ARRAY CAN BE USED BY RFFTF AND RFFTB.
!
!
!     OUTPUT PARAMETERS
!
!     R       R(1) = THE SUM FROM I=1 TO I=N OF R(I)
!
!             IF N IS EVEN SET L =N/2   , IF N IS ODD SET L = (N+1)/2

!                       (-1)**(I-1)*R(I)
!
!      *****  NOTE
!                  THIS TRANSFORM IS UNNORMALIZED SINCE A CALL OF RFFTF
!                  FOLLOWED BY A CALL OF RFFTB WILL MULTIPLY THE INPUT
!                  SEQUENCE BY N.
!
!     WSAVE   CONTAINS RESULTS WHICH MUST NOT BE DESTROYED BETWEEN
!             CALLS OF RFFTF OR RFFTB.
