!     SUBROUTINE RFFTI(N,WSAVE)
!
!     SUBROUTINE RFFTI INITIALIZES THE ARRAY WSAVE WHICH IS USED IN
!     BOTH RFFTF AND RFFTB. THE PRIME FACTORIZATION OF N TOGETHER WITH
!     A TABULATION OF THE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS ARE COMPUTED AND
!     STORED IN WSAVE.
!
!     INPUT PARAMETER
!
!     N       THE LENGTH OF THE SEQUENCE TO BE TRANSFORMED.
!
!     OUTPUT PARAMETER
!
!     WSAVE   A WORK ARRAY WHICH MUST BE DIMENSIONED AT LEAST 2*N+15.
!             THE SAME WORK ARRAY CAN BE USED FOR BOTH RFFTF AND RFFTB
!             AS LONG AS N REMAINS UNCHANGED. DIFFERENT WSAVE ARRAYS
!             ARE REQUIRED FOR DIFFERENT VALUES OF N. THE CONTENTS OF
!             WSAVE MUST NOT BE CHANGED BETWEEN CALLS OF RFFTF OR RFFTB.
